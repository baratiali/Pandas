    "Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python. At the heart of this library is the DataFrame. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dictionary of Series objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you create a simple DataFrame in Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'apples': [3, 2, 0, 1], \n",
    "    'oranges': [0, 3, 7, 2]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "purchases = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(purchases)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   apples  oranges\n",
    "0       3        0\n",
    "1       2        3\n",
    "2       0        7\n",
    "3       1        2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the keys of the dictionary (`apples` and `oranges`) become the DataFrame column names. The values in the dictionary (lists of numbers) become the data in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a DataFrame from a list of lists (nested list), where each inner list is treated as a row in the DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [[3, 0], [2, 3], [0, 7], [1, 2]]\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['apples', 'oranges'])\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output the same DataFrame as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great features of DataFrame is that it allows you to have an index. An index is like an address, that’s how you find data across the dataframe. By default, the index is the row numbers. But you can specify an index when creating the DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "purchases = pd.DataFrame(data, index=['June', 'Robert', 'Lily', 'David'])\n",
    "print(purchases)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        apples  oranges\n",
    "June         3        0\n",
    "Robert       2        3\n",
    "Lily         0        7\n",
    "David        1        2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can quickly look up the number of purchases for a particular person using the `loc` attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(purchases.loc['June'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "apples     3\n",
    "oranges    0\n",
    "Name: June, dtype: int64\n",
    "```\n",

    "In the Pandas library, a `Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a Series as a single column of data in a table. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet, a field in a database, or a vector in a mathematical matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pandas.core.series.Series` simply indicates the full namespace of the `Series` object in pandas. It tells you that `Series` is a class in the `series` module, which is in the `core` package of the `pandas` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you create a simple `Series` in pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting object is a pandas `Series`, which is printed as a column of values with an associated index on the left. The dtype indicates the data type of the series. In this case, it is `float64` because we included `np.nan` which is considered as a floating point number. If we had not included `np.nan`, the series dtype would have been `int64`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify your own index labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'])\n",
    "\n",

    "Updating data in a Pandas DataFrame involves modifying the existing values of the DataFrame. You can update data in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Updating a single value**: You can update a specific value by selecting it using its index and column name and then assigning a new value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "   \n",
    "   data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 24, 26]}\n",
    "   df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Updating the age of Alice to 27\n",
    "   df.at[0, 'Age'] = 27\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Updating an entire column**: You can update the values of an entire column by selecting the column and assigning new values to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Updating the entire Age column\n",
    "   df['Age'] = [30, 31, 32]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updating multiple values based on a condition**: You can use boolean indexing to update multiple values in the DataFrame that meet a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Increasing the age by 1 for everyone older than 25\n",
    "   df.loc[df['Age'] > 25, 'Age'] += 1\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Updating using `apply()` and `applymap()`**: The `apply()` function can be used to apply a function along the axis of the DataFrame, while `applymap()` is used to apply a function to each element of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Using apply to update the Name column\n",
    "   df['Name'] = df['Name'].apply(lambda x: x.upper())\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Using applymap to update the entire DataFrame\n",
    "   df = df.applymap(str)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Updating using `replace()`**: The `replace()` function is used for replacing values in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Replacing 'ALICE' with 'Eve'\n",
    "   df.replace('ALICE', 'Eve', inplace=True)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   print(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that, in general, when updating data in a Pandas DataFrame, you should be careful not to accidentally overwrite data that you may need later. It is often a good practice to keep the original data in a separate DataFrame or create a copy before making updates."

    "1. **apply**: The `apply` method is used to apply a function along the axis of the DataFrame (either rows or columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: Apply a function to each column:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import pandas as pd\n",
    "     \n",
    "     df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})\n",
    "     \n",
    "     # Sum each column\n",
    "     result = df.apply(sum, axis=0)\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Example: Apply a function to each row:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Sum each row\n",
    "     result = df.apply(sum, axis=1)\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. **map**: The `map` method is used with a Series. It is used to substitute each value in a Series with another value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: Map values in a Series:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     s = pd.Series(['cat', 'dog', 'mouse'])\n",
    "     \n",
    "     # Map animal names to their lengths\n",
    "     result = s.map(len)\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **applymap**: The `applymap` method is used to apply a function to each element of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: Apply a function to each element in the DataFrame:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})\n",
    "     \n",
    "     # Square each element in the DataFrame\n",
    "     result = df.applymap(lambda x: x**2)\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. **replace**: The `replace` method is used to replace a set of values with another set of values. You can replace a single value, multiple values, or a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: Replace values in a DataFrame:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})\n",
    "     \n",
    "     # Replace 1 with 10 and 6 with 60\n",
    "     result = df.replace([1, 6], [10, 60])\n",
    "     print(result)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods has its own specific use case, and you would choose the one that best fits the operation you need to perform."

    "Adding or removing rows and columns from a DataFrame is a common operation. Here's how you can do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add a Column**:\n",
    "   You can add a new column to an existing DataFrame by simply assigning data to a new column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Sample DataFrame\n",
    "   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Add new column 'C' with values [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "   df['C'] = [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove a Column**:\n",
    "   You can use the `drop` method to remove a column by specifying its name and setting the `axis` parameter to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Remove column 'C'\n",
    "   df = df.drop('C', axis=1)\n",
    "   # Alternatively, you can use 'inplace' parameter to drop it in-place\n",
    "   # df.drop('C', axis=1, inplace=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add a Row**:\n",
    "   You can add a new row to the DataFrame using the `append` method. You need to provide the new data as a dictionary where keys are column names and values are the data for the new row.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Add new row with values 4, 9\n",
    "   new_row = {'A': 4, 'B': 9}\n",
    "   df = df.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Remove a Row**:\n",
    "   You can remove a row by index using the `drop` method and setting the `axis` parameter to `0` (default). \n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Remove row at index 2\n",
    "   df = df.drop(2, axis=0)\n",
    "   # Alternatively, you can use 'inplace' parameter to drop it in-place\n",
    "   # df.drop(2, axis=0, inplace=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Insert a Column at a Specific Location**:\n",
    "   You can use the `insert` method to add a new column at a specific position.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Insert new column 'C' at index 1 with values [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "   df.insert(1, 'C', [7, 8, 9])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Add Multiple Columns**:\n",
    "   You can also add multiple columns at once by providing a dictionary of column names and their corresponding data to the `assign` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Add columns 'D' and 'E'\n",
    "   df = df.assign(D=[1, 2, 3], E=[4, 5, 6])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "These are the basic operations for adding or removing rows and columns from a DataFrame in pandas. Depending on the complexity of your dataset and the operations you need to perform, there are also many more advanced methods and techniques available in the pandas library."

    "Sorting data in a DataFrame is a common operation that helps you to organize and analyze your data. Pandas provides several methods to sort your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort by Index**:\n",
    "    You can sort the DataFrame by its index using the `sort_index` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sample DataFrame\n",
    "    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [2, 1, 3], 'B': [5, 4, 6]}, index=[2, 1, 3])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Sort by index\n",
    "    df_sorted = df.sort_index()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort by Column Values**:\n",
    "    You can also sort the DataFrame based on the values of one or more columns using the `sort_values` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Sort by column 'A'\n",
    "    df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='A')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sort by multiple columns 'A' and 'B'\n",
    "    df_sorted = df.sort_values(by=['A', 'B'])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sort in Descending Order**:\n",
    "    By default, the sorting is done in ascending order. You can sort in descending order by setting the `ascending` parameter to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Sort by column 'A' in descending order\n",
    "    df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='A', ascending=False)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sort and Keep the Index**:\n",
    "    When you sort a DataFrame, the index gets rearranged. If you want to keep the original index, you can reset it before sorting and then set it as index again after sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Reset index, sort by 'A', and set the original index back\n",
    "    df_sorted = df.reset_index().sort_values(by='A').set_index('index')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **In-place Sorting**:\n",
    "    The methods above return a new DataFrame by default. If you want to sort the DataFrame in-place, you can set the `inplace` parameter to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Sort by column 'A' in-place\n",
    "    df.sort_values(by='A', ascending=False, inplace=True)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Sorting by Data Types**:\n",
    "    You can also sort by data types by setting the `na_position` parameter to either `'first'` or `'last'`. This is particularly useful when your column has missing values (`NaN`), and you want to control their position in the sorted DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Sort by column 'A' and put NaN values first\n",
    "    df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='A', na_position='first')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the common ways to sort data in pandas DataFrames. Depending on your needs, you can use these methods and their parameters to sort your data effectively."

    "## Grouping and Aggregating - Analyzing and Exploring Your Data\n",
    "Grouping and aggregating data are powerful techniques for data analysis and exploration. In Pandas, you can use the `groupby` method for grouping data and various aggregation functions like `sum`, `mean`, `count`, etc. to analyze the grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to demonstrate these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample DataFrame\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Department': ['HR', 'IT', 'IT', 'Sales', 'HR', 'Sales'],\n",
    "    'Employee': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave', 'Eve', 'Frank'],\n",
    "    'Salary': [50000, 80000, 90000, 60000, 55000, 70000],\n",
    "    'Years_of_Experience': [2, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Group data by 'Department'\n",
    "grouped = df.groupby('Department')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   After grouping, you can perform aggregation on the grouped data. For example, let's calculate the average salary and experience in each department.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Aggregate by taking mean of Salary and Years_of_Experience\n",
    "    aggregation = grouped.agg({'Salary': 'mean', 'Years_of_Experience': 'mean'})\n",
    "    print(aggregation)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Aggregations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can also perform multiple aggregations at once by passing a list of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Aggregate by taking both mean and sum of Salary\n",
    "   aggregation = grouped.agg({'Salary': ['mean', 'sum']})\n",
    "   print(aggregation)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grouping by Multiple Columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can group by multiple columns by passing a list of column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Group by both 'Department' and 'Years_of_Experience'\n",
    "   multi_grouped = df.groupby(['Department', 'Years_of_Experience'])\n",
    "   aggregation = multi_grouped.agg({'Salary': 'mean'})\n",
    "   print(aggregation)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterating through Groups**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can iterate through each group and perform specific computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for name, group in grouped:\n",
    "       print(name)\n",
    "       print(group)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Applying Custom Functions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can apply custom functions to groups using the `apply` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Function to calculate range of salary in each group\n",
    "   def salary_range(group):\n",
    "       return group['Salary'].max() - group['Salary'].min()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Apply custom function to each group\n",
    "   custom_agg = grouped.apply(salary_range)\n",
    "   print(custom_agg)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Using `pivot_table` for Aggregation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sometimes, it’s more insightful to display data in a pivot table format. Pandas offers the `pivot_table` function to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Create a pivot table to display mean salary per department\n",
    "   pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Salary', index='Department', aggfunc='mean')\n",
    "   print(pivot_table)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining `groupby` with aggregation functions allows you to analyze and explore your data effectively, providing insights into different subsets and characteristics of the data."

    "## Working with Dates and Time Series Data\n",
    "Working with dates and time series data is a common task in data analysis. Pandas provides robust support for working with date and time data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing Dates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you read in data, dates might not be immediately recognized as a date or timestamp. To ensure that pandas treats these as dates, you can use `pd.to_datetime()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Parsing date strings into datetime objects\n",
    "    df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2021-01-01', '2021-02-01', '2021-03-01']})\n",
    "    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-Based Indexing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once your dates are recognized as timestamps, you can set them as the index of your DataFrame. This can be useful for time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Set the 'date' column as the index\n",
    "    df.set_index('date', inplace=True)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resampling Time Series Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Often, you’ll want to resample time series data to different frequencies. You can use the `resample` method for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Resampling to monthly frequency, calculating the mean for each month\n",
    "    monthly_data = df.resample('M').mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Resampling to daily frequency, forward-filling missing data points\n",
    "    daily_data = df.resample('D').ffill()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Date Offsets**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use date offsets to implement more complex logic when working with time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Adding 1 day to all the entries in the 'date' column\n",
    "    df['date'] += pd.DateOffset(days=1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rolling Windows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rolling functions are used to perform some operation on a rolling window of data, such as calculating a moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Calculating the 7-day rolling mean of a time series\n",
    "    df['rolling_mean'] = df['column_name'].rolling(window=7).mean()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extracting Date Components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can extract specific components of a date, such as the year, month, day, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Extracting year, month, day\n",
    "    df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year\n",
    "    df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month\n",
    "    df['day'] = df['date'].dt.day\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Extracting the day of the week\n",
    "    df['weekday'] = df['date'].dt.weekday\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Time Deltas**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time deltas represent durations, which can be useful for calculating differences between dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Calculating the difference between two dates\n",
    "    df['time_since'] = df['date'] - pd.Timestamp(\"2021-01-01\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Shifting and Lagging**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sometimes you might need to shift or lag your data for time-based comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Shifting data by 1 period\n",
    "    df['lagged'] = df['column_name'].shift(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Shifting data by -2 periods\n",
    "    df['lead'] = df['column_name'].shift(-2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas offers a wide range of functionalities for time series data that are too extensive to cover completely here. However, these examples should help you to get started with basic date and time series manipulations."

    "This line of code defines a small function (called a lambda function) named `d_parser` which takes a single argument `x` and converts it into a datetime object using a specific format. The purpose of this function is to parse date strings in a particular format and convert them to datetime objects, which can be easily manipulated and analyzed in Python. Let's break down the components of this code for better understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **lambda**: This is a keyword in Python used to create small anonymous functions. These functions are called anonymous because they don't have a name like regular functions defined with the `def` keyword. In this case, though, `d_parser` is assigned to the lambda function, effectively naming it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **x**: This is the input parameter to the lambda function. It represents the date string that you want to convert to a datetime object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **pd.datetime.strptime**: This is a method available in pandas (abbreviated as `pd`). The `strptime` method stands for \"string parse time\". It's used to parse strings representing dates and times into Python datetime objects. Note that as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, `pd.datetime` is deprecated, and it's recommended to use `pd.to_datetime` or directly use `datetime.strptime` from the `datetime` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **'%Y-%m-%d %I-%p'**: This is a format string. It tells the `strptime` method how to interpret the date string. In this format string:\n",
    "   - `%Y` represents a four-digit year (e.g., 2023).\n",
    "   - `%m` represents a two-digit month (e.g., 07 for July).\n",
    "   - `%d` represents a two-digit day of the month (e.g., 09).\n",
    "   - `%I` represents a two-digit hour in 12-hour format (e.g., 02 for 2 AM or 2 PM).\n",
    "   - `%p` represents either AM or PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might use this `d_parser` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the lambda function\n",
    "d_parser = lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x, format='%Y-%m-%d %I-%p')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example date string to be converted\n",
    "date_string = '2023-07-09 02-PM'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the d_parser function to convert the date string to a datetime object\n",
    "converted_date = d_parser(date_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output the result\n",
    "print(converted_date)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet would output a datetime object representing July 9th, 2023 at 2 PM."
